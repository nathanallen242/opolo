# Opolo 🧠

## Description

Opolo is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** app designed to streamline interactions with research papers. It was created to familiarize myself with different parts of the RAG pipeline and to continuously iterate as I learn more. Opolo utilizes a **Llama 3.2** model installed within **WSL**, along with **Ollama embeddings** and a **Chroma DB** for efficient data management.

## Features

- **Streamlined Interactions 🛠️:** Easily interact with research papers through a user-friendly interface.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation 🔍:** Enhances information retrieval by combining retrieval mechanisms with generation capabilities.
