# Opolo: LLM RAG CLI App
Opolo is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) CLI app designed to streamline interactions with research papers.
Created as a way to familiarize myself with different parts of the RAG pipeline, and continuously iterate as I learn more.
Uses a Llama 3.2 model installed within WSL, w/ Ollama embeddings & a Chroma DB.
